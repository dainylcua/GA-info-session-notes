## Notes on Twitter's Interview Process and Apprenticeship

Twitter apprenticeship hires more on a culture fit than a requirement fit, talk more about yourself!

Talk through your process when working on code: even if you don't know exactly how it works it's good for the interviewer to understand your thought process

Twitter's apprenticeship program opens once-a few times per year

All stages of the internship process are very conversational

## Notes on Kenneth's experience

Kenneth works on the front-end for the Twitter Web app, not the mobile app

He works with React and Redux 99% of the time

Thought process at work begins with planning everything out for a decent amount of time, then turns into 60:40 ratio of coding:meeting in regular workday

Workday coding:meeting ratio will change day to day, but will generally fit this schema
